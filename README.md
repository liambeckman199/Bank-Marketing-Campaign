Cleaned a bank's historical marketing data in Python to create logistic regression and random forest tree models with Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn that predicted the likelihood of a future customer purchasing a product.

The project incorporated several data science and machine learning practices:

● Creating Seaborn data visualizations during data exploration.
● Feature cleaning and engineering.
● Over and under sampling data to handle unbalanced datasets.
● K-folds cross validation to leverage more data for training and testing.
● Hyperparameter tuning with grid search algorithms.
