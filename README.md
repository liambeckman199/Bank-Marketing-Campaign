Cleaned a bank's historical marketing data in Python to create logistic regression and random forest tree models with Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn that predicted the likelihood of a future customer purchasing a product.

The project incorporated several data science and machine learning practices:

1. Creating Seaborn data visualizations during data exploration.
2. Feature cleaning and engineering.
3. Over and under sampling data to handle unbalanced datasets.
4. K-folds cross validation to leverage more data for training and testing.
5. Hyperparameter tuning with grid search algorithms.
